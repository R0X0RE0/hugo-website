Why does this abomination of a packaging exist? We've invented flaps that work, sometimes too well, for boxes like plastic silverware. Sometimes the cereal box flaps work. These flaps do get ripped up or unused sometimes and it leaves behind at worst either a big ol' mess or stale cereal. What makes these flaps different from Hot Pockets flaps is the fact that they actually work as intended. A 5 year old can figure out how to work a cereal box flap. I'm an adult and I can't figure out how the Hot Pockets flap works.  

I'm questioning if they have a team to review or even design the packaging. They probably hired 5 interns at best that knew jack shit about designing packages. They probably sketched really good designs for user interfaces and got thrown in to the HQ to design a package, because their executives can't differentiate designers. All they had to do was copy what design worked for cereal boxes or plastic silverware boxes, but no, they had to go for originality and create something that I'd bring a roll of duct tape for.  

Now, with this in mind, you might be looking for alternatives to this piece of garbage pocket. You might consider eating it without the pocket. However, the pocket protects you from the hot ass food, so you'll be burning your hand when you're burning your mouth off as well. You might grab a paper towel, one paper towel, and wrap it around the food. This is good thinking, but it's going to fall apart once you let go of it and it's just as good as using the pocket without the bottom being sealed. Take that and learn, and create a bottom with another paper towel. Again, it's going to fall apart. You know about this, and you add adhesive, whether it be tape or glue, on the paper towels, and you put the hot pocket in there. This design might unironically be better than the official pocket design.  

Another weird thing about the Hot Pocket is the packaging. The box is cardboard, the wrapper is plastic, and the pocket is made of card. Card and cardboard decomposes, but plastic doesn't. It might be a design convention, but it isn't very consistent. If it were stored in a paper wrapper, it'd make more sense, because the packaging is 100% decomposable. At least with water bottles, which is by the way one of the biggest scams on this planet unless if your tap water is shit, the container holding the bottles is plastic, and the bottles are made of "recyclable" plastic.
